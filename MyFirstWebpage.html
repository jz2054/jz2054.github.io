<h1>Welcome To My First Webpage!</h1>
  
<div>
   <p>This is also my first file in my new Git Repo.</p>
</div>

  <div id = "later"> <p>The assignment of later to id enables us to perfom an operation such as styling only on
    the contents of the div tag containing that assignment. This is also an example/demonstraton of a tag attribte. The 
    attribute is referred to as an id and there is a way we select in css if we are using an external file or the styling tag.
  </p>
    <p class = "more"> Suppose <em>div</em> has many children and we wanna perform an operation on contents within a specific
    child of <em>div.</em> In that instance we can assign that child a <strong>class</strong> attribute for selction when we want
    to act upon i.e styling or behaviour using javascript.</p>
  </div>    

  <p>Stay tuned for more to come</p><br>
